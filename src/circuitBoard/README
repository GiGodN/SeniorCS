ANALYSIS:
	
	I believe that using a queue would result in a better search algorithm because
	a stack would pick a branch and then explore it to the end, where a queue 
	would explore all paths equally fast, this could result in a faster search
	algorithm as you can then trim your possible tree to only the paths sorter 
	than the current best path. I believe that the queue search should have 
	around a n log(n) runtime where using stacks it will have a n^2 runtime 
	where n is the longest path, because the queue search will end up exploring 
	less of the total map with more branches, and stacks will pick one branch and
	explore it to its fullest so it will have to explore every branch up until its 
	finished
