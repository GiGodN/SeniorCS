OVERVIEW:
	
	This is a self created Index Unsorted List that 
	uses double linked nodes to store the data.
	
Included Files:
	
	* IUDoubleLinkedList.java - source file
	* ListNode.java - source file
	* ListTester.java - test file
	* IndexedUnsortedList.java - interface
	* README - this file
	
COMPILING AND RUNNING:

	From the directory containing all source files, compile the
	driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
	$ javac ListTester.java

	Run the compiled class file with the command:
	$ java ListTester

	Console output will give the results after the program finishes.
	
PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
	
	We learned how ListIterators worked and how they
	differ in implementation from a Iterator.
	
	The remove element method was given to us,
	which is not as useful as a remove index function
	so I adapted the algorithm from the remove element
	function and created the remove index function
	The add function is almost verbatim from my single
	linked list with added lines to update the previous 
	reference in the nodes.
	
TESTING:

	I used the pre-curated test to test most of the functionality,
	then wrote test to test the added functionality.
	
DISCUSSION:
	
	I encountered problems with the add methods because of the previous
	node pointer that is included in a double linked list. Improperly
	updating this pointer in my add methods created some problems
	later down the link. Almost all of my time spent on this project was
	spent creating tests, as the list part was just adapting the single
	linked list homework to this project.
