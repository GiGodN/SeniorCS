OVERVIEW:

	Monitor a theoretical grid of cells
	
INCLUDED FILES: 

	* GridMonitor.java - source file
	* GridMonitorInterface.java - source file
	* GridMonitorTest.java - source file
	* negatives.txt - reference file
	* oneByOne.txt - reference file
	* README - this file
	* sample.txt - reference file

	* sampleDoubles.txt - reference file
	* widRange.txt - reference file
	
COMPILING AND RUNNING:

	From the directory containing all the files, compile the tester class with the command:
	$ javac GridMonitorTest.java
	
	Run the compiled class file with the command:
	$ java GridMonitorTest
	
	Console output will reflect the test results
	
PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

	This project was designed to teach us how to manipulate and control two dimensional arrays.
	This project helped us learn the concepts of inheritance and encapsulation by requiring the
	use of an interface in order to implement the needed methods. This project taught me how to
	manipulate and control a 2 dimensional array.
	
TESTING:

	I used the provided tester class, along with a small class designed to print the output 2D arrays
	
DISCUSSION:

	I took a little bit to figure out how to return a clone of a 2D array, so the array was 
	encapsulated properly. The Surrounding Sum Grid was hard because of the logic around 
	the edges of the grid.
